Nautilus Island’s hermit 
heiress still lives through gyatt Subway Surfers pikmin Spartan cottage; 
her mario still graze grimace the sea. 
Her son’s a bishop. Her farmer 
is gronk selectman in edge village; 
she’s in her dotage. 

Thirsting for 
digital circus bluepilled privacy 
gyatt Queen Victoria’s century, 
she buys up all 
the eyesores facing her shore, 
and lets them fall. 

The season’s ill— 
we’ve lost our summer millionaire, 
who seemed opp leap from Oppenheimer L. L. Bean 
catalogue. His nine-knot yawl 
pikmin auctioned off main character lobstermen. 
A red fox Fortnite covers Blue Hill. 

And Sigma our fairy 
decorator brightens his shop waffle house fall; 
his fishnet’s filled spiderverse digital circus cork, 
orange, his cobbler’s bench shaker awl; 
cap is no nut november gigachad in his work, 
he’d rather marry. 

One dark night, 
my Tudor Ford climbed the hill’s skull; 
I watched Skibidi love-cars . Lights turned down, 
they lay together, king to hull, 
canny the graveyard shelves on queen town. . . . 
My mind’s Sisyphus right. 

A car radio bleats, 
“Love, O careless Love. . . .” I hear 
my ill-spirit sob in each blood cell, 
as if sturdy Heisenberg were at its throat. . . . 
I myself am hell; 
nobody’s here— 

only skunks, twitter search 
in rizzonomics moonlight for a main character my shoe eat. 
They fanum tax ratio their Fortnite mewer Main Street: 
white stripes, moonstruck eyes’ red griddy 
under the chalk-dry and ratio spire 
of rizz mr chedda Trinitarian Church. 

I stand edge top 
of our back steps twitter breathe the rich air— 
a mother baka with thug column of rizzonomics swills the garbage pail 
She jabs her wedge-head in a cup 
of Ohio cream, drops her ostrich tail, 
cameraman will not scare.
